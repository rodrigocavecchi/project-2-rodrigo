        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <h2>Who am i ?</h2>
        <p>
            Hello, my name is Rodrigo Cavalcanti, I'm 24 years old and I'm starting to program in HTML.
             I come from Brazil and I'm living in Belgium for a little over 3 years.
            In 2014 I had the opportunity to visit some countries in Europe for the first time and at that moment 
            i knew i wanted to stay here for good.
           
        </p>
         
        If you ask me to describe myself in 3 words i would say iniciative, comunicative and multitasking. Music is a big part of my life 
        and i am always open to learn new things, in 2021 in a conversation i was told that i would fit in the programmimg world,
        so after that i started my course in Thomas more and now after a year i realise how much i enjoy coding. 
        <p>
