            <h3>Here I will show you my CV and tell you a bit more about my experience in the job market.
                 I have worked in Brazil, Belgium and at the moment in the Netherlands.
                 It is clear that I have already done some different types of work but
                  I had not yet discovered that programming was my true passion, 
                  I am striving to improve more and more in the area 
                  and to be able to stand out soon.My first job was as an insurance broker
                   in one of the biggest insurance companies in South America,
                    I was very happy but I had the opportunity to move to Europe 
                    and when you have this chance the best thing to do is follow your dreams.
                    When I arrived in Belgium, I did some interim work, 
                    which was very manual and physically heavy. 
                    Finally my current job where I had the opportunity to grow 
                    within the company and develop my passion for programming.  </h3>
